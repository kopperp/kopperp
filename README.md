Aerospace Engineer (ERAU '17 | U. of Stuttgart '18). Currently a Doctoral student at Institute of Aircraft Propulsion System, University of Stuttgart, Germany. Research interest lie in simulation of particle-laden flow with a high-order accurate Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM) solver and High-Performance Computing (HPC). Most recent publication is 'An efficient halo approach for Euler-Lagrange simulations based on MPI-3 shared memory' (HPC Asia 2021 Companion).
